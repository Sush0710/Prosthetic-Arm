# Prosthetic-Arm

Enclosed within this repository is the code utilized for our 3D printed prosthetic arm endeavor. Our team has successfully crafted an economical and effective prototype with the potential to greatly improve the daily lives of many amputees. This code enables the prosthetic arm to execute basic tasks, including gripping a key or forming a fist, by controlling the motors for the elbow, wrist, and fingers. In future, we aim to further develop it further into a smooth functioning prototype in the future
